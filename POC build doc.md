## 2. Pivots, Rescoping, and Deviations

### Initial Proposal:
- Tower defense game with first person view

### Changes Made:
- **Pivot/Rescoping**:
    - Insufficient work output to implement first-person view. May eliminate from design.

## 6. De-risking Core Gameplay Mechanics

Mechanic 1: Enemy Spawning

- Risk Addressed: Ensuring enemies can spawn at balanced intervals without breaking pacing.

- PoC Approach: Placeholder enemies spawn at set intervals to test pacing and adjust difficulty before adding advanced features.

Mechanic 2: Combat

- Risk Addressed: Ensuring combat feels balanced and intuitive.

- PoC Approach: Simple combat with basic hit detection and damage to test core mechanics before including animations or adding abilities.

Mechanic 3: Tower Defense Pathfinding

- Risk Addressed: Ensuring enemies follow the correct path without getting stuck or deviating.

- PoC Approach: Enemies follow a simple, predefined path to check if the basic pathfinding logic works.
